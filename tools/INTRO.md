# Neutralino devtools

Various tools to make Neutralino API dependencies consistent.

**NOTE** 

These script can use:
- wildcards `*` in path patterns
- sequential commands with `&&`
- parallel commands with `&`
- shebang `#!`

If like me you don't have a LINUX compatible terminal, a simple way is to use [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
